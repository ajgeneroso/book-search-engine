## Description
A MERN stack search engine for books.

## Usage
When the Search Engine loads, the user is presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

When the Search for Books menu option is selected, the user is presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.

If the user is not logged in and they enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

When the user clicks on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.

When the toggle is set to Signup, the user is presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button.

When the toggle is set to Login, then the user is presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button.

When a valid email address is entered and create a password and click on the signup button, the user account is created and I am logged in to the site.

When the user enters their account’s email address and password and click on the login button, the modal closes and the user is logged in to the site.

When logged in to the site, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout.

When the user is logged in and enters a search term in the input field and clicks the submit button, they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account.

When the user clicks on the Save button on a book, then that book’s information is saved to my account.

When the user clicks on the option to see my saved books, they are presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account.

When the user selects the Remove button on a book, that book is deleted from my saved books list.

When the Logout button is selected, the user is logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
